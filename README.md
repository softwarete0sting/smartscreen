Smartscreen, also known as Windows Defender Smartscreen (with its smartscreen.exe), is a very useful security feature that belongs to the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Originally introduced in Windows 8, this utility aims to prevent you from downloading malware. Now, Windows 10 has an improved version of this utility. When you open Task Manager, you may see the process SmartScreen running in the background.

## How does SmartScreen work?

If you download an application or file from the Internet, SmartScreen Filter will check it against Microsoft's database.

If the app or file has been viewed before and is considered secure, it may pass through the SmartScreen filter. If the app has been visited before but is considered dangerous, SmartScreen will block malware to protect your computer from virus infection.

However, if the file has never been viewed before, and Windows isn't sure it's safe, Windows will prevent the application from running and warn you that it may be dangerous, but you can also choose to bypass this warning .

If you are using Windows Defender as the default antivirus program on your computer, SmartScreen is executed by an antimalware service executable process. It helps to keep your computer secure. That's why you should always keep it enabled.
